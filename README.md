# mockingbird - Android birdsong study

I took a course on bird song this past spring. Each week the instructor
distributed a number of songs for us to learn. I tried using a few different
free flash card apps on my phone, but the ones I looked at required first
creating a deck, adding the name of the bird and then attaching the song file. 
In each case, after spending the time to create a deck, the audio failed to
play. I ended up using a media player instead, which was frustrating, because
I would inadvertently end up seeing the names of the songs as I was skipping
ones I had already recognized.

Mockingbird takes a simpler approach. Create a directory on your sdcard, either
inside a Mockingbird directory or elsewhere. Copy your songs to it, along with
a picture or two if you want, and you're ready to go. The metadata for the audio
file is used to display the name of the bird. If no metadata exists, the file
name is used instead. Songs are shuffled and played in a random order each time
through.
